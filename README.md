# red(dit)sea

Get it? Red *dit* sea?

Aaanyway, this theme was designed for the 7thSea Subreddit, and if you've found yourself here you're most likely one of the fine mods over there.

##Instructions

1. Copy contents of 'theme.css' and images into 'http://reddit.com/r/7thSea/about/stylesheet'.
2. Change Reddit logo to 'snooskull.png' at 'http://reddit.com/r/7thSea/about/edit'.
3. If you want to try this out elsewhere, just replace the name '7thSea' with the name of the subreddit you wish to target.

##Development

Since apparently I'm not *'popular'* enought to create a subreddit on which to test this on, I have no idea if everything works. This also means I haven't been able to test this on anything but Chrome using the Stylebot plugin. So trial by fire it is, and if you are one of the aforementioned mods and what access to this repo, just ask.
